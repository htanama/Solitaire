SOLITAIRE GAME RULES

Set Up

First, deal out the cards into seven columns. The first column on the left has one card, the
second column has two cards, the third has three cards, continuing to seven columns. The top
card in each column is turned face up, the rest of the cards are face down.
The remaining cards go face down in a single stack called the stock pile.

How to Play:

Cards that are face up and showing may be moved from the stock pile or the columns to the
foundation stacks or to other columns.
To move a card to a column, it must be one less in rank and the opposite color. For example, if it
was a 9 of hearts (red), you could put an 8 of spades or clubs onto it. Stacks of cards may be
moved from one column to another as long as they maintain the same order (highest to
lowest, alternating colors).
If you get an empty column, you can start a new column with a King. Any new column must be
started with a King (or a stack of cards that starts with a King).
To get new cards from the stock pile, you turn three cards at a time face up into the stack next
to the stock pile called the waist stack. You can only play the top card off the waist stack. If you
run out of stock cards, turn the waist stack over to make a new stock pile and start again, pulling
the top three cards off, turning them over, and starting a new waist stack.
